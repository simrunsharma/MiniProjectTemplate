# MLOPS Template
[![.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/simrunsharma/MiniProjectTemplate/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simrunsharma/MiniProjectTemplate/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Summary:
This template was created to create a workflow that incorporates the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automation process. This automation process was utiliized to increase efficiency of the checking and testing of code and make sure we understand the known state of our code at all time. Linting is incorporated in our workflow build to ensure our code is follwing the standard conventions of python.

## Specific Benefits (detailed by [Benefits of CI/CD Workflow])(https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/what-is-ci-cd/)

1. **Higher Efficiency**
   - Automation streamlines development and deployment processes.
   - Eliminates the need for manual commands and tasks.

2. **Reduced Risk of Defects**
   - Frequent testing and deployment catch errors early.
   - Mitigates risks by identifying and fixing issues in real-time.

3. **Faster Product Delivery**
   - Enables multiple daily releases with minimal manual intervention.
   - Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Travis CI facilitate rapid delivery.

4. **Log Generation and Observability**
   - Logging provides crucial insights into system performance.
   - CI/CD generates extensive logging data for observability.

5. **Quick Rollback**
   - Allows easy and rapid rollback of code changes in case of issues.
   - Ensures minimal production interruptions.

6. **Better Planning**
   - Facilitates adaptability to changing business conditions.
   - Ensures organized surplus and continuous communication.

7. **Efficient Testing & Monitoring**
   - Automates testing to achieve quality delivery quickly.
   - Continuous monitoring ensures application health and stability.

8. **Cost-Effectiveness**
   - Enhances code quality, reducing critical issues.
   - Improves overall Return on Investment (ROI).
